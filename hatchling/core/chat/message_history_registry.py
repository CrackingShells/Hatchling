    This class provides a centralized mapping between UIDs and their
    corresponding MessageHistory instances. It enables global access to
    histories while providing extensible history management with full
    async/coroutine safety.
    
    The registry follows these principles:
    - Single source of truth for UID-to-history mappings
    - Dynamic registration and lookup with async safety
    - Clear error handling for missing UIDs
    - Extensibility for future history management features
    - Async/coroutine-safe mutations using asyncio.Lock
    
    Concurrency Model:
    - All mutation operations (register, unregister, clear) are protected by asyncio.Lock
    - Read operations (get_history, is_registered, get_registered_uids) are lock-free
      for performance, unless strong consistency during concurrent mutations is required
    - Each MessageHistory instance manages its own internal mutation safety
