# Glossary

This glossary defines technical terms used throughout the Hatchling documentation.

## A

**Access Level**: Security classification for settings that determines modification permissions (normal, protected, read-only).

**API**: Application Programming Interface - a set of protocols and tools for building software applications.

## D

**Dot Notation**: A way of accessing nested dictionary values using dots to separate levels (e.g., `settings.llm.model`).

## F

**Fallback**: Automatic use of English translations when a translation is missing in the selected language.

## I

**i18n**: Internationalization - the process of designing software to support multiple languages and regions.

**ISO 639-1**: International standard for language codes (e.g., "en" for English, "fr" for French).

**Protected Setting**: A setting that requires explicit confirmation (--force flag) to modify due to its sensitive nature.

## R

**Registry Pattern**: A design pattern that provides a centralized location for storing and accessing objects or data.

**Runtime Switching**: The ability to change settings or language without restarting the application.

## S

**Settings Category**: A logical grouping of related settings (e.g., llm, paths, ui).

**Singleton Pattern**: A design pattern that ensures only one instance of a class exists globally.

## T

**TOML**: Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language - a configuration file format used here for translation files and settings.

**Translation Key**: A unique identifier used to look up translated text (e.g., `settings.llm.model.name`).

## U

**UI**: User Interface - the means by which users interact with the application.
